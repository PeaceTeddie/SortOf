SortOf
======
A project that sorts almost any folder into an extension based category system (ex. Archives, Documents, etc...).
Also has the ability to unsort a previously sorted folder, in other words, just empties the premade folders into the parent directory.

Please excuse the crude UI as this was my first ever project which I made back in 2012 and haven't touched for quite a few years.
